# 🎮 Games Explorer — Assignment 13

A dynamic **Games Explorer App** built using **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)** in JavaScript and **Async API integration**.  
The app fetches real game data from the **RAWG API** and displays it in an interactive, responsive UI.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🧩 Fully modular structure using **OOP Classes**
- 🎮 Fetch and display games by category
- 📄 View **detailed game information** on click
- 🔄 Smooth switching between **Games Section** and **Game Details Section**
- 🌐 API communication using **fetch + async/await**
- 🎨 Responsive UI following the given design
- 📁 Clean code structure (UI Class – Details Class – Main App Class)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **Bootstrap**
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **OOP Classes**
- **RAWG API** (Games API)
- **Async/Await + Fetch API**

---

## 🧩 How It Works

1. The **Games section** loads default categories (MMORPG – Shooter – etc.).
2. Clicking on any game:
   - Sends a request to the API with the game **ID**
   - Loads all details (description – rating – release date – …)
3. The Games section hides, and the **Details section** appears.
4. You can return back to games anytime.
5. UI handling (display/hide) is fully controlled by a **dedicated UI class**.
